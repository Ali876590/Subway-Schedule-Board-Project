# Subway Schedule Board Project
The goal of this project was to develop a C++-based computer programme that would assist users in determining which subway tracks to take in order to get where they need to go. The programme accomplishes this by accepting a few inputs, saving values in 1D and 2D arrays, and processing the data before showing the results on a scheduling board. This application utilises a randomizer to virtually produce users who are displayed next to you on the scheduling board in order to integrate testing restrictions (the original passenger).
